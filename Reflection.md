Another pivot I made during the project was adding another class called App in order to run the scanner and also print things. 
At first I had everything in the minesweeper class but after consideration and talking to the professor I realized there should be no print lines in that class and creating "another layer" by adding the App. 
One of the key aspects I thought about was changing the win condition to an int instead of a boolean. 
This just added a third option (0 is on going, -1 is lose, 1 is win), instead of a true and false which doesnt allow an ongoing objection the -1,0,1 adds that extra layer.
It was interesting to break the project apart step by step, slowly expanding, and adding tests. 
I also liked that we had to implement the tester and assertions which is a new concept to me I need to build confidence on. By adding all the assertions and different tests for different steps.
It was also helpful for me to make mistakes, learn from them, improve my methods and build my tests, and repeating that cycle in order to improve the project.
